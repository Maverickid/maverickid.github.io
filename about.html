        <p>Ever woke up late on a Saturday morning, made a sandwich in your pyjamas and thought to your self, "This has to be the best fucking sandwich ever made in the world" ?
        Well, that is exactly what I did on Jan 6th, 2024. With barely opened eyes I put together 2 garlic breads and stuffed in between it a Tyson chicken patty, a smear of mayonnaise and
        BBQ sauce, a thin slice of onion and tomato and exactly one leaf of lettuce. And lo and behold, on the first bite of that sandwich, my eyes widened and I had one of
        those really rare moments people have in life, where you know your life is not going to be the same again.
        <br><br><br>But the question still lingered...was it the best or could a better sandwich exist in the tangible confines of the planet we inhabit, that you and I are not aware of? And of course, I know what you are thinking.."it is all subjective, kiddo". But that very thought is what I wanted to explore.
        <br><br><br> So going with my gut(pun intended) and having recently learnt what HTML stands for, I embarked on this project where we each can build our own sandwiches, take a poll and see if our collective conciousness would converge on a clear winner.
        <br><br><br>Thus was born 'The Deli Deli-cious Project'. If you think you have a winner in mind, I urge you to sumbit your sandwich stack. We will tally the votes at the end of the year
        and will declare the results on my instagram account.
        <br><br><br>I have made the final sandwich render a shareable image of how you like your sandwich, incase your room-mates were wondering. *wink* x 2</p>
